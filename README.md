# Elections-Data-Scraper
Web scraper for historical presidential election results by county

Project Description: This is a web scraper that pulls data from Dave Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections. The election_results method pulls the data from the atlas and convert it into a Pandas dataframe. Other methods convert results into xlsx files and text files used in the election visualization program MapChart.

This is an independent, personal project, and is not affiliated with the University of Maryland or any other organization or individual. The project concept and implementation is mine, and all code is written by me, using knowledge obtained by the University of Maryland and independent studies.
