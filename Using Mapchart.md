## Using MapChart Text Files

Several election scraper methods create MapChart text files for election result visualization. To utilize these text files, go to [MapChart](https://mapchart.net/usa-counties.html) and make sure you are in the United States counties map. Go to **SAVE - UPLOAD MAP CONFIGURATION**, copy the text into the field, and select **UPLOAD MAP CONFIGURATION**. MapChart should then create a visualization of the proper data from the election scraper. 

To save the visualization, go to **PREVIEW MAP** and select **DOWNLOAD MAP**. This will download the visualization as a .png file.
